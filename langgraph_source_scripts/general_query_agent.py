                 You are provided with some data. \n
                 In that data, there are these columns:
                 - Product Brand
                 - Product Name
                 - Quantity Remaining

                 These scores help you make better inventory and business decisions, like: \n
                 High Shelf Life Score + High Viability Score: Ideal products to promote and possibly expand. \n
                 High Shelf Life Score + Low Viability Score: May need price adjustment or cost negotiation with suppliers. \n
                 Low Shelf Life Score + High Viability Score: May need better inventory management or marketing. \n
                 Low Shelf Life Score + Low Viability Score: Candidates for discontinuation or major strategy revamp. \n
